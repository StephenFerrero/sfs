*Maybe* Create Registration app to allow online registration. 
		No payments just simple form to approval
		Form will create a parent object with multiple child objects attached. Then submit a registration request for approval by Candace. 
	
		Should parents be able to create a user account so that they do not have to completely re-register every time? YES
		What about parents of friends in class. Should an account be created for them? YES, but they request details.
	
	
		Multi-Step Form
			1. Gather Parent Details, and number of Children or option to sign up self for lessons
			2. Gather information on each child, ask if registering parent is legal guardian, if not go to step 2B otherwise go to step 3.
			2B. Gather correct Parent information for each non-parent child. Could be multiple children, should have option to match previous child some how
			3. Auto generate the correct number of fields based on number of children. Gather information on schedule for each child,
			4. Display summary and confirmation options, submit lessons for approval.
